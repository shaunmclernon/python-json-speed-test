# Python/json speed test

>Test to test process a large json file using python using ijson.

This repo was built based on a blog post [Python - Iterate Over Massive JSON Files]. Wanted to do some experiments on how quickly python and ijson can process large files.

>NOTE: This is only meant to give some rough metrics.

## Generate some test data

To do this test, lets generate some test data.

Create a file with 5 million random json objects, which takes about 30 seconds
approximately and will generate a 4.4G file.

```bash
time php generate_test_data.php 5000000
```

```bash
php generate_test_data.php 5000000  35.03s user 34.43s system 84% cpu 1:22.35 total
```

## dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the test

Now lets do a crude test on how long it takes to process our newly generated JSON file.

```bash
time python3 count.py --file data/test_with_5000000_entries.json
```

Output:

```bash

There are 5000000 items in the JSON data file.
python3 count.py --file data/test_with_5000000_entries.json  42.85s user 27.95s system 97% cpu 1:12.62 total
```

The experiment can be tried with different sized files.
